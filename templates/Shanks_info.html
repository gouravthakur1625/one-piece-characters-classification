                        <p><b>"Red-Haired" Shanks,[9] commonly known as just "Red Hair",[12] is the chief[5] of the Red Hair Pirates[2] and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World.[3]

                            Sailing with the Roger Pirates since he was an infant, Shanks would begin his pirate career on their ship as an apprentice alongside Buggy, before forming his own crew after Roger's death.[4]
                            
                            Notably, Shanks is the pirate who inspired Monkey D. Luffy to go on his own pirate journey,[13] and his crewmate Lucky Roux found the Gomu Gomu no Mi that was accidentally eaten by Luffy.[14] He also owned the Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday.
                            
                            Ever since the beginning of the series, Shanks has been an important background character, usually being shown accompanying Luffy's ever-growing reputation as a pirate. He is a late, but still vital ally during both the Marineford and Wano Country Arcs. He and his crew also have a sizable role in One Piece Film: Red, which centers on Uta, Shanks' daughter.</b></p>
